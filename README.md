## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
*   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

```bash
# Install Wrangler globally if you haven't already
bun install -g wrangler
```

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd vibepulse_dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun for package management.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Authenticate with Cloudflare:**
    Log in to your Cloudflare account to be able to run the project locally and deploy it.
    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Hono backend worker, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the application, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will hot-reload on changes, and the worker will restart automatically.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

*   `src/`: Contains the React frontend application, including pages, components, hooks, and styles.
*   `worker/`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker backend code, built with Hono. This is where API routes and Durable Object logic reside.
*   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and mock data shared between the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.

## üîß Development

### Frontend

*   All React components are located in `src/components`.
*   Pages are located in `src/pages`. The main dashboard is `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`.
*   Reusable UI elements are built using `shadcn/ui` and can be found in `src/components/ui`.
*   Global state is managed with Zustand.

### Backend

*   API endpoints are defined in `worker/user-routes.ts` using Hono's routing syntax.
*   Data models (Entities) for Durable Objects are defined in `worker/entities.ts`.
*   The core Durable Object logic is abstracted in `worker/core-utils.ts`. **Do not modify this file.**

To add a new API endpoint, open `worker/user-routes.ts` and add a new route handler.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment to Cloudflare's global network.

1.  **Build the application:**
    This command bundles the frontend and prepares the worker for deployment.
    ```bash
    bun build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    Run the deploy command. Wrangler will handle the process of uploading your assets and worker script.
    ```bash
    bun deploy
    ```

Alternatively, deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click:
